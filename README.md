## Python BSC Contract Generator
Create and deploy token within minutes without any knowledge of Solidity.
Simple to use.
If you have wallet that you want to use with this script create new file called 'wallet' and save your keys using format below
```
publicAddress,privateKey
```
Otherwise script will make new wallet and you'll need to send at least 0.005 BNB for gas fee.

IT'S NOT SAVE TO STORE PRIVATE KEYS ANYWHERE ON COMPUTER SO I RECOMEND TO CREATE NEW CLEAN WALLET

Usage:
1. Start with 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
2. Follow instrucions on screen
